# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project demonstrates a complete **machine learning workflow** — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — using multiple classifiers to compare their performance.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle null values, encode categorical features, scale features)
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Train and evaluate several ML models
- Compare their accuracy and performance metrics

---

## 🧩 Models Used
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (`GaussianNB`)
- Decision Tree Classifier (`DecisionTreeClassifier`)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (`KNeighborsClassifier`)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Dataset Loading & Exploration**
2. **Handling Missing Values**
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
4. **Feature Scaling**
5. **Splitting Dataset**
6. **Model Training & Testing**
7. **Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, etc.)**

---

## 📈 Results
The notebook compares model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision to identify the best-performing algorithm for the dataset.
